# About me



- 🔭 I’m currently working on being accepted into CODE KENTUCKY. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on new projects. 
- 📫 How to reach me: TrishS7777@gmail.com 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a Mutuel Clerk (Teller) at the Thoroughbred racetracks in Kentucky. I've also traveled to work at Pimlico & Belmont Racetracks, and "The Little Brown Jug" at 
     the Fair Grounds in Delaware, Ohio.  It is fun, but seasonal and only work a few days a year. 🐎
- 🦩🌴 Looking forward to traveling to all the places on my bucket list some day! 🦋
